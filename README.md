# Cryptocurrencies
 
## Overview
One of my important clients, Accountability Accounting, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. I put together a data learning model and with the help of some data they provided, used a clustering algorithm to help visualize the data.
 
## Results
Using Unsupervised learning, we were able to find 532 tradable crypto currencies and put them into 4 different classes for further study.
